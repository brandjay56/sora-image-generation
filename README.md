## 🖼️ Image-to-Video Generation

Sora can now animate or transform your images and videos! This powerful feature allows you to:

### Text-to-Video (Default)
Generate videos purely from text descriptions - no input needed. Perfect for creating scenes from scratch.

### Image-to-Video
1. **Upload an image** (PNG, JPG, JPEG, WEBP)
2. **Write a prompt** describing how you want it animated
3. Examples:
   - "The person smiles and waves at the camera"
   - "Camera slowly zooms in, clouds moving across the sky"
   - "Waves crash against the shore at sunset"

### Video-to-Video
1. **Upload a video** (MP4, MOV, AVI)
2. **Write a prompt** describing how you want it transformed
3. Sora will modify and enhance your video based on the prompt

> ⚠️ **Note**: Video-to-video generation may not be available to most users yet due to OpenAI's current access restrictions on this feature.

### Important Notes:
- ⚠️ **Real People**: Uploading images of real people is restricted. Only use images with explicit permission.
- 🎯 **Best Results**: Be specific in your prompt about the motion/transformation you want
- 📐 **Resolution**: Input should ideally match your desired output resolution

## 💡 Tips for Best Results

- **Be specific and descriptive** - The more detail you provide, the better the results
- **Mention camera movements** - Include details like "camera pans left to right" or "slow zoom in"
- **Describe lighting and mood** - Specify "golden hour lighting" or "dramatic shadows"
- **Include subject details** - Describe what's in the scene thoroughly
- **Specify time of day** - "at sunset", "early morning fog", etc.

## 📝 Example Prompts

**Nature Scene:**
```
A serene sunrise over a misty mountain lake, with a lone canoe gliding across the water. The camera slowly pans from left to right, capturing the golden light reflecting off the gentle ripples.
```

**Urban Scene:**
```
A bustling Tokyo street at night, neon signs reflecting on wet pavement after rain, people with umbrellas walking past glowing storefronts, camera tracking shot.
```

**Abstract:**
```
Colorful ink drops dispersing in crystal clear water, shot in slow motion against a white background, vibrant purples and blues mixing together.
```

**Cinematic:**
```
An astronaut floating in space, Earth visible in the background, dramatic lighting from the sun, slow rotation revealing details of the spacesuit, wide cinematic shot.
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

**"Please enter your OpenAI API key"**
- Make sure you've entered a valid API key in the sidebar
- Ensure your API key is active and has access to the Sora models
- API keys can be obtained from [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/)

**"Error creating video" or "API Error"**
- Check that your API key has access to Sora models
- Verify your OpenAI account has sufficient credits
- Ensure your prompt doesn't violate OpenAI's usage policies
- If uploading an image of a person, ensure you have explicit permission

**"Video generation likely failed" or status check errors**
- This often indicates a content policy violation
- The video may have contained prohibited content (e.g., real people without permission)
- Try a different prompt or image
- Some prompts may be flagged by OpenAI's safety systems

**"Video generation is taking longer than expected"**
- Sora 2 Pro typically takes 60-120 seconds
- Sora 2 typically takes 45-90 seconds
- Complex prompts or high resolutions may take longer
- Check the video history section and use the "Refresh Status" button

**App won't start**
- Make sure all dependencies are installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Check that you're using Python 3.8 or higher: `python --version`
- Verify Streamlit is installed: `streamlit --version`

**Cannot recover a previous video**
- Use the "Add Video by ID" feature in the Video History section
- Note: Videos may expire or be removed after a certain period
- Content policy violations will result in videos being removed from the API
